### 

Create
a simple program that **can convert a
decimal number to its binary representation**. Implement an elegant solution **using a Stack**.

**Print the binary representation**
back at the terminal.

#### Examples

**Input**

 

**Output**

 

10

 

1010

 

1024

 

10000000000

#### Hints

### 

·        
If the given number is 0, just
print 0

·        
Else, while the number is
greater than zero, divide it by 2 and push the remainder into the stack

·        
When you are done dividing, pop
all remainders from the stack – that is the binary representation
